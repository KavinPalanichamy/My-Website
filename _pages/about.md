I am a final-year Mechatronics student with a passion for robotics and automation. I have a strong foundation in programming and designing robotic systems, with proficiency in Python, C, and C++. My hands-on experience includes developing software for UWB-based indoor positioning systems, programming PLCs, and designing mechanical solutions using 3D printing and Autodesk Inventor. 

Having completed internships at companies like Desion GmbH and Łukasiewicz – PIAP, I have honed my skills in automation and robotic applications. I am particularly interested in exploring innovative solutions that integrate hardware and software to enhance robotic capabilities. I am excited to start my career as a Robotics and Automation engineer in January 2025 and am eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology. 

In my free time, I enjoy learning new programming techniques, exploring advancements in robotics, and staying updated on industry trends.
